# Next Firebase REST

Simple example showing how to load data from a private Firebase database using the REST API.

In order to run this example, you will need to identify the SECRET for your firebase database and set it as a environment variable. Here's how you can pass it to `npm start`:

```sh
FIREBASE_SECRET='replace_with_your_firebase_database_secret' npm start
```

The backend data is available there : <https://olifante-a2cf8.firebaseio.com/dinosaurs.json>
